Photography is the intentional noticing of things. When I walk to work in the morning, the scenery becomes dull with each passing season as I grow used to the imagery. If I have my camera and walk with intention, then I begin to _notice_. I see elements of architecture, of nature, and of people that I would otherwise miss. Photography, in this sense, becomes a form of mindfulness—a way to reconnect with the world around me, to see it anew, and to capture fleeting moments that might otherwise dissolve into the background of daily life.

When I first purchased a *proper* camera—the Ricoh GR IIIx—it was for my upcoming "trip" to Tokyo, Japan. This trip was intended to be a one-year research fellowship in a lab at the University of Tokyo, but life had other plans. Two and a half years later, I’m still here, immersed in both my work and the city’s endless visual tapestry. The Ricoh became my constant companion, a tool that allowed me to document Tokyo’s intricate details: the way light casts harsh shadows between skyscrapers, the vibrant chaos of Shibuya Crossing, or the quiet elegance of a lone cherry blossom in a neighbourhood park. Its compact size made it perfect for everyday carry, and its discreet design allowed me to capture candid moments without drawing attention.

But as much as I loved the Ricoh, there were limitations. Tokyo’s weather, with its sudden downpours and humid summers, often created perfect conditions for photography—puddles reflecting neon lights, mist clinging to skyscrapers, or rain-soaked streets glistening under the glow of convenience store signs. Yet, the fear of damaging my camera in the rain meant I often had to juggle an umbrella, which, in the crowded streets of Tokyo, could feel like a barrier to grabbing my camera and heading out into the streets. At the same time, I was facing the prospect of spending more and more time in the snow-laden landscapes of Hokkaido. I began to consider something more robust, something that could withstand the elements and allow me to shoot freely, no matter the conditions.

This year, I upgraded to a more "pro" camera: the Fujifilm X-T5. This decision was not solely driven by a desire for improved image quality or technical capabilities—the X-T5 holds the same size sensor (APS-C), though it does bring with it its renowned colour science and film simulations. It was also about liberation. The X-T5 allowed me to experiment with different focal lengths, capturing both the grandeur of a temple gate and the intimacy of a stranger’s fleeting expression. Most importantly, it gave me the confidence to photograph in the rain and snow, to embrace spontaneity without hesitation.

Yet, even with this upgrade, I find myself returning to the core of what photography means to me: the act of noticing. Whether I use the Ricoh or the Fujifilm, it is the practice of seeing—truly seeing—that brings out the beauty in the ordinary. Photography has taught me to slow down, to appreciate the interplay of light and shadow, and to find beauty in the mundane. It is not merely about the camera I carry, but how it shapes my perspective and deepens my connection to the world around me.

The act of observation—that is where the essence of photography lies. To slow down, to sit back and observe, and to notice those things that often fade into the background of our lives.
